<h2>Sonnet 116</h2>
<p>
Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
Or bends with the remover to remove:
</p>
<p>
O no; it is an ever-fixed mark,<br>
That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;<br>
It is the star to every wandering bark,<br>
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
</p>
<p>
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If this be error and upon me proved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
